This repository contains an example application written for Open Data Kit (ODK)
Tables. ODK Tables is a data manager and visualizer for Android devices.
Complete Android apps, including data entry, synchronization, and distribution,
can be written using HTML and JavaScript files. ODK Tables will serve these
files as the skin of your app.

Projects intending to write a Tables app can clone this repository and use it
as a starting point.

Much of the boilerplate of app creation can be avoided by employing the Grunt
tasks specified in the Gruntfile.

For a more complete description of how to use this repository, please see this
entry on the official ODK wiki:

Suggestions and corrections are welcomed in our efforts to make the
documentation more complete and the app easier to use. Please send to:
